# Bootstrap jQuery Mobile Theme

A jQuery Mobile theme based on Bootstrap.

The title says it all. I thought it would be a fun project to build out a jQuery Mobile theme emulating everyone's favorite hotness, the Bootstrap UI library. It's not a perfect translation of course, but consider it a work in progress.

This theme overrides the existing jQuery Mobile A - E swatches (and adds an F swatch as well) with colors and styles found in Bootstrap. It's meant to be used with A as the primary swatch for the page, and B - F as accents as needed.

Make your Bootstrap theme complete by using Font Awesome icons found in the [jQuery Mobile Icon Pack](https://github.com/commadelimited/jQuery-Mobile-Icon-Pack).

**Updated for jQuery Mobile 1.2!
